	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hello world. I'm Nikki Yutuc. I was born and raised on Saipan, CNMI, which is a small island in the Pacific.  
	Being from a diverse and tight-knit community helped me learn important life lessons. 
	<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I graduated in Spring of 2016 from Saipan Southern High School, where I attended for 4 years. While in high school I
	played the trumpet in my school band, competed in various sports, and was a commander for the JROTC drill team.
	<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I recently moved to Orono, ME to attend the University of Maine. I am currenlty in my first year at the university and 
	am enjoying it so far.
